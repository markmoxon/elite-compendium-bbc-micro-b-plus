# Source code for the Elite Compendium

This folder contains the source code for the Elite Compendium.

* [elite-disc.asm](elite-disc.asm) builds a SSD disc image from the binaries in the subprojects

* [elite-readme.asm](elite-readme.asm) generates a README file for inclusion on the SSD disc image

The bulk of the source code comes from the project's submodules.

Right on, Commanders!
